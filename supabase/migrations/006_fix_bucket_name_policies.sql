-- Author: AI Assistant

-- Drop existing policies with wrong bucket name
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role full access uploads" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role full access processed" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public read processed" ON storage.objects;

-- Service role full access to uploads directory (correct bucket name)
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (
    bucket_id = 'noname-banana-images-prod' AND
    name LIKE 'uploads/%'
);

-- Service role full access to processed directory (correct bucket name)
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access processed"
ON storage.objects FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (
    bucket_id = 'noname-banana-images-prod' AND
    name LIKE 'processed/%'
);

-- Public read access to processed directory (correct bucket name)
CREATE POLICY "Public read processed"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (
    bucket_id = 'noname-banana-images-prod' AND
    name LIKE 'processed/%'
);
