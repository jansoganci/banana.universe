## üö® **ALERT THRESHOLDS**

### **High Usage Alert**
- **Daily spending > 1000 credits**: Consider monitoring for abuse
- **Quota utilization > 80%**: Consider increasing limits
- **Active users < 10**: Consider promotional campaigns

### **Performance Alerts**
- **Table size > 1GB**: Consider archiving old data
- **Query time > 5 seconds**: Consider adding indexes

---

## üìÖ **RECOMMENDED MONITORING SCHEDULE**

### **Daily (5 minutes)**
1. Run `admin_daily_system_check()`
2. Check `admin_system_alerts()`
3. Review `admin_daily_usage_summary` for today

### **Weekly (15 minutes)**
1. Run `admin_weekly_growth_analysis()`
2. Review `admin_top_spenders` for top 20 users
3. Check `admin_user_retention` trends

### **Monthly (30 minutes)**
1. Review `admin_revenue_analytics` for trends
2. Analyze `admin_performance_metrics()` for optimization
3. Check `admin_user_retention` for long-term trends

---

## üîß **CUSTOMIZATION TIPS**

### **Adjusting Thresholds**
- **High spending threshold**: Modify the 1000 credit limit in alerts
- **Low activity threshold**: Change the 10 user minimum in alerts
- **High balance threshold**: Adjust the 1000 credit limit for balance alerts

### **Adding Custom Metrics**
- Create new views following the same pattern
- Use `public.is_admin_user()` for security
- Grant permissions to `authenticated` role
